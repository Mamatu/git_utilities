Bash script which specifies middle commit between two branches. Very early version.

For example:
middle_commit.sh crash_1_fail crash_4_pass

will print:
commit 623e22e9a010d7736aff838662034574970421d4

It can be usefull in the case of looking up some bug (by binary search) which wasn't detected earlier.
